          <p>Hi there! My name is Bella Rivera, and I am a third-year computer
            science student at the University of Washington. Some of my favorite
            areas to work in are website development, product design and prototyping
            (as they relate to HCI), and of course full-stack software development.
            In addition, for the past couple of years, I have been involved in the
            teaching side of computer science, serving as both a teaching
            assistant and student lead for an introductory computer science program
            at the University of Washington.

            <br></br>

            On a more general note, I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington
            after both of my parents immigrated from the Philippines. Despite not
            being a huge fan of the weather, I love the city, which is why I chose
            that beautiful photo of downtown Seattle as my homepage background.
            Although I did not take the photo myself, I did some light editing on it,
            which is one of my favorite hobbies.  I have such a passion for creative
            projects, whether that be photo/video editing, music production, sketching,
            writing poetry — the list goes on.

            <br></br>

            Other random interests: soccer, bubble tea, purple, karaoke, The Office, guitar, photography
